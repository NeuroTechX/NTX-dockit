Sponsorship / Partnership
===============

Local vs Global
---------------
NTX Chapters are responsible to do their own fundraising and handling (and fulfilling) their partnerships and sponsorships.
NTX and its BoD is there to support and guide the Chapters as much as possible, but each Chapter needs to establish its own process for sponsorship and fundraising.
Having someone in the team focusing on sponsorship/partnership will make a big difference in a chapter's success in the long run.

NTX has various types of partners and sponsors. NTX has global partnerships supporting different initiatives (e.g. Chapters, Student Clubs, etc.)
NTX Chapters and NTX Initiatives should avoid contacting our global partners before contacting the BoD first to reduce the number of channels and requests to our partners.

It is important to see sponsorship as a relationship. NeuroTechX is a nonprofit and intend to play a key role in the field for the next decades.
NTX reputation, integrity and credibility is VERY important and should NEVER be compromised. 
As a Chapter Admin or Initiative Leader you represent the brand and should always keep these in mind.


Resources & Materials

Here are some resources to help you with sponsorships.

Sealing the Deal
----------------
The NTX Chapters and NTX Initiative can handle their "deals" with partners without prior acknowledgment from the BoD for transactions under $1000.
For transactions above $1000, the BoD should be informed prior to final agreement and signatures*. Once again, NTX reputation is our number 1 priority and we are all working together.
Things done by one Chapter, impact also the others. We want to make sure we don't over commit and/or over promise.


Money Handling
--------------
The money always flow through the organization's bank account and not through individuals bank account.
The money is currently centralized in NeuroTechX HQ and redistributed to chapters and initiatives.
The Finance Director (Ferdinand) is the one handling these transaction. 
We do have many different processes in place to facilitate exchange of money both between NTX and our partners, and also NTX and its chapters.
