Values, Ethics & Integrity
--------------------------
We live in an amazing time in history. Our relationship with technology is about to change drastically with emerging biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, neurotechnologies, robotics and artificial intelligence.
The pace at which technology is moving forward is getting faster and faster as we get more connected and that more people have access to knowledge. Thanks to high speed Internet and its soon to be worldwide coverage.
The potential of neurotechnology is inspiring, but not without ethical concerns. Even if it might feel like it is early for ethical discussions around neurotechnology, it is important to keep the discussions current
with the field, from fuzzy medical claims to consumer *bs* claims to privacy, there is plenty to discuss already and to keep these in mind as we shape the field. We are currently laying the foundations, might as well do it right!

Also, it is important for NeuroTechX to remain unbiased. NeuroTechX has no commercial interests, but do offer services and have partnerships and sponsorships. 
Therefore, it might appears from time to time that some companies are getting more visibility than others from NeuroTechX. 
That being said, NeuroTechX will never compromise its integrity and values for money. This is why the organization is not-for-profit and shall remain so.
We are in this because we believe that the future looks bright, but will not happen on its own and naturally for the greater good.

**We believe that transparency, open source, collaboration and dissemination of information will help tilt the field in a positive future.**
