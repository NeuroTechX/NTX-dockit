#HackNights
======









Preparations
------------------------

Post to FB, slack, or whatever local channels you have

During
------------------------

Set up a little sign showing people directions to the room from the street, to know they are in the right place. “Neurotech Group this way!” “You’re here at the Neurotech Group!” Cartoon drawings of brains are a nice touch

Newcomers: If there are many newcomers, they will often ask the SAME BASIC questions. Separate these from the regular attenders. Have a “new person introduction,” given by an established “new person greeter” so that other organizers aren’t distracted. Collect names and emails, or have them sign up to your FB group / slack channel / whatever your main communications channel is. 

After
------------------------

Send a little summary of what happened, what you did, what people built, or whatever to the FB group or slack channel. 

In between the week
------------------------

Post fun / interesting resources and info, keep the conversation going.
