Initiatives
=====
NeuroTechX is devoted to facilitate the advancement of neurotechnology with its bottom-up approach. In order to do so, our activities, services and products are categorized under what we call *initiatives*.
When we launch a new initiative, we always keep our 3 main pillars (community, education & innovation) and our vision in mind. Here are the current focus of NeuroTechX.


NTX Slack
----------
Our Slack (chat platform) counts over 1500 neurotech enthusiasts from all around the world exchanging on various topics related to neurotech.


NTX Chapters
----------
Aside from our strong online community, the strengh of NTX resides in its local chapters around the world. Through various events and activities a NeuroTechX chapter seeks to build a strong local neurotech ecosystem.


NTX EDU
----------
Online educational platform for neurotechnology. Very hands on, the goal of that online platform is for people who’d like to experiment with neurotech, but don’t know where to start. No need to Google for months.


NTX Student Clubs
----------
NeuroTechX is proud to support undergrad students from around the world to get hands on experience on today & tomorrow’s skills while working on stimulating multidisciplinary neurotech projects that they then showcase in our NTX International NeuroTech Competition. 


NTX Recruitment
----------
With its exponentially growing talented and motivated network, NeuroTechX is uniquely positioned to help with recruitment (match-making).
