If you are interested in creating a chapter in your city, please fill out the following  `form <http://goo.gl/forms/HFqTewsKTn>`_ to let us know. 

We will then arrange a call with you to chat so that we can get to know you better and get you started in creating a chapter in your city. 

Once you are confirmed, you will be ready to start your chapter! We like to make your life simple so that you can spend all of your time meeting new people and getting your community to grow. 
When you sign up to create a chapter, we will help you in creating the following:

Setting up the Meetup Page    
-----------
		
		
Although it will likely be taken care of you, in certain situations you may need to set it up yourself.  Here is a step by step guide on what to do.

1. Go to `Meetup.com <http://www.meetup.com>`_ and select Start a Meetup Group. 

2. Select the city you will be hosting the event.  If you make a mistake you will be required to reach out to Meetup and ask them to change it)


3. You will then need to provide Meetup with the keywords that you want your group to be associated with. For best results, use the following:

	- Brain-Computer interface
	- Open Source
	- Innovation
	- Neuroscience
	- Education & Technology
	- New Technology
	- Quantified Self
	- Brain
	- Neurotechnology
	- bionics
	- Technology
	- DIY Technology
	- man-machine interface
	- Man-machine Integration
	- Neuroengineering


4. You will then be asked to select a name. Please select one that has the format of Neurotech(capitalized abbreviation of your city/town or if your city doesn't usually have one, the full name. For example NeuroTech San Francisco would be NeuroTechSF, but Neurotech Lima would be NeuroTechLima)

5. You will then need a description. Be creative! Something that people in your city or region will identify with. However if you need inspiration, you can use the following to get your brain juices started:
	
	| Hello brainiacs of the world! NeuroTechDC is the Washington D.C. chapter of NeuroTechX, a global network of engineers, designers, scientists, and hackers devoted to discovering the countless mysteries of the human brain and nervous system!
	| From medical to consumer devices, we'll talk about 'reading' and 'writing' the brain. (e.g. EEG, tDCS, TMS, DBS, ...) We'll discuss about the technology and science, but also its impact on our society and the ethics.
	| From Hackers to Researchers we want to provide a framework that will catalyze the growth of the neurotech enthusiasts network. If you call yourself a cyborg, neurohacker, neuroengineer, neurodesigner, a BCI evangelist, or if you want to learn what any/all of those words/phrases mean, come to our next hack night!
    | --
	|Join the conversation on Slack, Facebook & Twitter and play an active role in the future of neurotechnology.
