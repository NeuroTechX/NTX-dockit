Getting Started
======

If you are interested in creating a chapter in your city, please fill out the following  `form <http://goo.gl/forms/HFqTewsKTn>`_ to let us know. 

We will then arrange a call with you to chat so that we can get to know you better and get you started in creating a chapter in your city. 

Once you are confirmed, you will be ready to start your chapter! We like to make your life simple so that you can spend all of your time meeting new people and getting your community to grow. 
When you sign up to create a chapter, we will help you in creating the following:

Setting up the Meetup Page    
-----------
		
		
Although it will likely be taken care of you, in certain situations you may need to set it up yourself.  Here is a step by step guide on what to do.

1. Go to `Meetup.com <http://www.meetup.com>`_ and select Start a Meetup Group. 

2. Select the city you will be hosting the event.  If you make a mistake you will be required to reach out to Meetup and ask them to change it)


3. You will then need to provide Meetup with the keywords that you want your group to be associated with. For best results, use the following:

	- Brain-Computer interface
	- Open Source
	- Innovation
	- Neuroscience
	- Education & Technology
	- New Technology
	- Quantified Self
	- Brain
	- Neurotechnology
	- bionics
	- Cognitive Neuroscience
	- DIY Technology
	- Man-machine integration
	- Neuroengineering


4. You will then be asked to select a name. Please select one that has the format of Neurotech(capitalized abbreviation of your city/town or if your city doesn't usually have one, the full name. For example NeuroTech San Francisco would be NeuroTechSF, but Neurotech Lima would be NeuroTechLima)

5. You will then need a description. Be creative! Something that people in your city or region will identify with. However if you need inspiration, you can use the following to get your brain juices started:
	
	| NeuroTech(your_city_abbreviation_here) is part of the NeuroTechX network. This group is to discuss about NeuroTechnology like Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). From medical devices to EEG consumer devices like the InteraXon's Muse, the OpenBCI board, the Emotiv's EPOC & Insight, the Neurosky's Mindwave we'll talk about 'reading' the brain. What about 'writing' the brain ? tDCS, TMS, DBS, ... Thync, Foc.us, ...Why not talk about NeuroEthics ? Should we 'zap' our brains ? Drugs can be smart ? Can they make me smarter ?
	| From Hackers to Researchers we want to provide a framework that will catalyze the growth of the NeuroTech enthusiasts network. We want to raise awareness and engage with people outside these fields that have no idea what's going on in the field of neurotechnology. (If you didn't understand anything described above, but are curious, join us.)
	| Because each city should have it's own personal NeuroTech community and connect with other NeuroTechX nodes around the world !
	| Join the Slack discussion and play an active role in the future of DIY NeuroTech. (send a PM message to one of the organizers with your name, email and why you would like to join!)




	
Designing your meetup page    
-----------

In order to make sure your city meetup page has the feel of being part of the NeuroTechX network, use the following Color Palette.
	
Color Palette:
	* Banner: #000000
	* Background: #000000
	* Links: #0fbbf3
	* Buttons: #0fbbf3
	
The banner image and profile picture can be found in your Neurotech assets folder and are conveniently labeled. 		
	

Once you're meetup page is completed, you are ready to start your first event!
